Socks via HTTP is a program converting SOCKS requests into HTTP requests and tunnelling
them through HTTP proxies if needed. The SOCKS protocol allows programs to traverse firewalls on any port number
and is used by many popular programs, like Napster, MSN Messenger, CRT(telnet client)
and many others. Many companies restrict firewall traversals only to HTTP requests,
disabling SOCKS proxy. Socks via HTTP provides a miniature SOCKS server for the SOCKS client,
performing its connection through an HTTP proxy to a remote server, which establishes the real connection.
